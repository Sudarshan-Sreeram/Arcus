## _ðŸ“¦ ARCHIVED_ â€” Arcus

### ðŸ‘‰ Update

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Further development on this project has __ceased__; well, unless the forks say otherwise. Please note that most, if not all, of the code in this repository was written in the _"hackathon rush"_. Thus, the codebase does not adhere to well-known industry practices and/or standards - it's quite messy (as expected for short-term rapid prototyping). Also, the GCP project associated with this repository has been terminated. Please __do not__ consider this codebase as an example of representative work from any of the contributors. ðŸ˜€
